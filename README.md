# The_Hundred_Analysis
Exploratory work using dataset from cricsheet (https://cricsheet.org/)

Using yaml data of hundred games I plotted a couple of graphs of some player statistics, then trained a model aimed at producing an output similar to DLS. I found that the model was overfit due to the limited data.
